lab1 

We have two machines: host1 and host2. Letâ€™s try to connect from host1 to host2 using ssh:

example

host1 (control node):  10.0.15.1
host2 (manage node): 10.0.15.2

1) On manage node generate the public private key pair for the user

ssh-keygen -t rsa 

2) Now from the managned node, it will promopt for username and password

ssh-copy-id root@10.0.15.2

#test using ping module

create a folder

1) mkdir labs
2) create inventory file (inventory.ini)
[my_hosts]
10.0.15.2 ansible_user=root ansible_connection=ssh
3) ansible -i inventory.ini all -m ping
